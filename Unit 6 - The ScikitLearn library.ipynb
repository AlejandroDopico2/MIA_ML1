    "# The ScikitLearn.jl library\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-learn library is an open source machine learning library developed for the Python programming language, the first version of which dates back to 2010. It implements a large number of machine learning models, related to tasks such as classification, regression, clustering or dimensionality reduction. These models include Support Vector Machines (SVM), decision trees, random forests, or k-means. It is currently one of the most widely used libraries in the field of machine learning, due to the large number of functionalities it offers as well as its ease of use, since it provides a uniform interface for training and using models. The documentation for this library is available at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Julia, the ScikitLearn.jl library implements this interface and the algorithms contained in the scikit-learn library, supporting both Julia's own models and those of the scikit-learn library. The latter is done by means of the PyCall.jl library, which allows code written in Python to be executed from Julia in a transparent way for the user, who only needs to have ScikitLearn.jl installed. Documentation for this library can be found at https://scikitlearnjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, this library provides a uniform interface for training different models. This is reflected in the fact that the names of the functions for creating and training models will be the same regardless of the models to be developed. In the assignments of this course, in addition to ANNs, the following models available in the scikit-learn library will be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "- Decision trees\n",
    "- kNN\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use these models, it is first necessary to import the library (using ScikitLearn, which must be previously installed with\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "import Pkg;\n",
    "Pkg.add(\"ScikitLearn\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The scikit-learn library offers more than 100 types of  different models. To import the models to be used, you can use @sk_import. In this way, the following lines import respectively the first 3 models mentioned above that will be used in the practices of this subject:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "@sk_import svm: SVC\n",
    "@sk_import tree: DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "@sk_import neighbours: KNeighborsClassifier\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When training a model, the first step is to generate it. This is done with a different function for each model. This function receives as parameters the model's own parameters. Below are 3 examples, one for each type of model that will be used in these course assignments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "model = SVC(kernel=\"rbf\", degree=3, gamma=2, C=1);\n",
    "model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=4, random_state=1);\n",
    "model = KNeighborsClassifier(3);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An explanation of the parameters accepted by each of these functions can be found in the library documentation. In the particular case of decision trees, as can be seen, one of these parameters is called `random_state`. This parameter controls the randomness in a particular part of the tree construction process, namely in the selection of features to split a node of the tree. The Scikit-Learn library uses a random number generator in this part, which is updated with each call, so that different calls to this function (together with its subsequent calls to the `fit!` function) to train the model will result in different models. To control the randomness of this process and make it deterministic, it is best to give it an integer value as shown in the example. Thus, the creation of a decision tree with a set of desired inputs and outputs and a given set of hyperparameters is a deterministic process. In general, it is more advisable to be able to control the randomness of the whole model development process (cross-validation, etc.) by means of a random seed that is set at the beginning of the whole process.\n",

    "Once created, any of these models can be adjusted with the `fit!` function.\n",

In contrast, non-deterministic models like artificial neural networks (ANNs), may exhibit variability in results due to factors like random weight initialization. ANNs require multiple training runs with varying initializations or data subsets. To enhance reliability, the outcomes from these different training runs can be aggregated, often by calculating statistical measures like the mean, providing a more stable representation of the model's performance.`"

    "As can be seen, the first argument of this function is the model, the second is an array of inputs, and the third is a vector of desired outputs. It is important to realise that this parameter with the desired outputs is not an array like in the case of ANNs but a vector whose each element will correspond to the label associated to that pattern, and can be of any type: integer, string, etc. The main reason for this is that there are some models that do not accept desired outputs with the one-hot-encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important issue to consider is the layout of the data to be used. As has been shown in previous assignments, the patterns must be arranged in columns to train an ANN, being each row an attribute. Outside the world of ANNs, and therefore with the rest of the techniques to be used in this course, the patterns are usually assumed to be arranged in rows, and therefore each column in the input matrix corresponds to an attribute, being a much more intuitive way.\n",

The desired outputs are typically categorical labels or continuous values that are not subject to the same scaling issues as input features. In classification problems, the output range is irrelevant because the output only determines in which class a sample belongs to, and is typically encoded using one-hot encoding. The output values are interpreted as probabilities for each class, and are already in the range [0,1]. Therefore, standardization is not necessary for the desired outputs in classification problems. However, in regression problems, it may be useful to standardize the output values to help the model deal with the multiple ranges that the output values can take.```\n",

    "- If the model is an ANN, the desired outputs shall be encoded by means of the code developed in previous assignments. As this model is non-deterministic, it will be nevessary to make a new loop to train several ANNs, splitting the training data into training and validation (if validation set is used) and calling the function defined in previous assignments to create and traing an ANN.\n",

    "- If the model is not an ANN, the code that trains the model shall be developed. This code shall be the same for each of the rematining 3 types of models (SVM, decision trees, and KNN), with the line where the model is called being the only difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "In turn, this function should return, at least, the values for the selected metrics. Once this function has been developed, the experimental part of the assignment begins. The objective is to determine which model with a specific combination of hyperparameters offers the best results, for which the above function will be run for each of the 4 types of models, and for each model it will be run with different values in its hyperparameters.\n",

The cross-validation technique does not generate a final model, but allows comparing different algorithms and configurations to choose the model or parameter configuration that returns the best results. Once chosen, it is necessary to train a \"final\" model from scratch by using all the patterns as the training set, that is, without separating patterns for testing. In this way, the performance of this model and configuration is expected to be slightly higher than that obtained through cross-validation, since more patterns have been used to train it. This is the final model that would be used in production, and from which a confusion matrix can be obtained."

    "In this assignment, it is necessary to pass parameters which are dependent on the model. To do this, the simplest way is to create a variable of type Dictionary (actually the type is `Dict`) which works in a similar way to Python. For example, to specify the parameters of an SVM, you could create a variable as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "parameters = Dict(\"kernel\" => \"rbf\", \"degree\" => 3, \"gamma\" => 2, \"C\" => 1);\n",

    "\n",
    "```Julia\n",
    "parameters = Dict();\n",
    "\n",
    "parameters[\"kernel\"] = \"rbf\";\n",

    "parameters[\"kernelGamma\"] = 2;\n",

    "```\n",
